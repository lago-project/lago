Release process
==================

Versioning
---------------

For lago we use a similar approach to semantic versioning, that is::

    X.Y.Z

For example::

    0.1.0
    1.2.123
    2.0.0
    2.0.1

Where:

 * ``Z`` changes for each patch (number of patches since ``X.Y`` tag)
 * ``Y`` changes from time to time, with milestones (arbitrary bump), only for
   backwards compatible changes
 * ``X`` changes if it's a non-backwards compatible change or arbitrarily (we
   don't like ``Y`` getting too high, or big milestone reached, ...)

The source tree has tags with the ``X.Y`` versions, that's where the packaging
process gets them from.

On each ``X`` or ``Y`` change a new tag is created.

For now we have only one branch (master) and we will try to keep it that way as
long as possible, if at some point we have to support old versions, then we
will create a branch for each ``X`` version in the form::

    vX

For example::

    v0
    v1


There's a command to resolve the current version, based on the last tag and the
compatibility breaking commits since then, to get the version for the current
repo run::

    $ python -c 'import pbr.packaging; print(pbr.packaging.get_version("lago"))'


RPM Versioning
----------------
The rpm versions differ from the generic version in that they have the
``-1`` suffix, where the ``-1`` is the release for that rpm (usually will
never change, only when repackaging without any code change, something that is
not so easy for us but if there's any external packagers is helpful for them)

Promotion of artifacts to stable, aka. releasing
-------------------------------------------------
The goal is to have an automated set of tests, that check in depth lago, and
run them in a timely fashion, and if passed, deploy to stable.
As right now that's not yet possible, so for now the tests and deploy is done
manually.

The promotion of the artifacts is done in these cases:

  * New major version bump (``X+1.0``, for example ``1.0 -> 2.0``)
  * New minor version bump (``X.Y+1``, for example ``1.1 -> 1.2``)
  * If it passed certain time since the last ``X`` or ``Y`` version bumps
    (``X.Y.Z+n``, for example ``1.0.1 -> 1.0.2``)
  * If there are blocking/important bugfixes (``X.Y.Z+n``)
  * If there are new features (``X.Y+1``)


How to mark a major version
----------------------------

Whenever there's a commit that breaks the backwards compatibility, you must
add to it the pseudo-header::

    Sem-Ver: api-break

And that will force a major version bump for any package built from it, that is
done so in the moment when you submit the commit in gerrit, the packages that
are build from it have the correct version.

After that, make sure that you tag that commit too, so it will be easy to look
for it in the future.

The release procedure on the maintainer side
---------------------------------------------
#) Select the snapshot repo you want to release

#) Test the rpms, for now we only have the tests from projects that use it:
    * Run all the `ovirt tests`_ on it, make sure it does not break anything,
      if there are issues -> `open bug`_

    * Run `vdsm functional tests`_, make sure it does not break anything, if
       there are issues -> `open bug`_

#) On non-major version bump ``X.Y+1`` or ``X.Y.Z+n``
    * `Create a changelog`_ since the base of the tag and keep it aside

#) On Major version bump ``X+1.0``
    * `Create a changelog`_ since the previous ``.0`` tag (``X.0``) and keep
       it aside

#) Deploy the rpms from snapshot to dest repo and copy the ``ChangeLog`` from
   the tarball to ``ChangeLog_X.0.txt`` in the base of the ``stable/X.0/`` dir

#) Send email to `lago-devel`_ with the announcement and the changelog since
   the previous tag that you kept aside, feel free to change the body to your
   liking::
