Yapf failed, make sure to run:
    yapf --style .style.yapf --in-place --recursive .

to format any python files automatically, it is higly recommended that you
install formatting tools to your editor, check the yapf repo:

     https://github.com/google/yapf/tree/master/plugins

to check for official support (always helpful).
You can also install the pre-commit hook provided in this repo:

    ln -s scripts/pre-commit.style .git/pre-commit

and it will format any files changed at commit time.
